## Getting Started

Start your Cleeng SVOD demo project with composer:

```bash
$ composer install
```

After installing the packages, go to the
`<project-path>` and start PHP's built-in web server to verify installation:

```bash
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t public/ public/index.php
```

Now, open 0.0.0.0:8000 in your browser, and you are done.
